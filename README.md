My name is Landon Baker, and I am a senior in Electrical Engineering at Mississippi State University. 
I am currently 21 years old, and I enjoy going to the gym. I also spend my free time watching TV/sports,
spending time outdoors, and visting with friends and family. I am interested in high voltage in Electrical Engineering.
