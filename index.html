   <h1>Landon's Digital Resume</h1>
   
    <body> 
       <p>My name is Landon Baker and I am in Electrical Engineering at Mississippi State University.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>I am very determined. </li>
         <li>I am always on time.</li>
         <li>I work well with others.</li>
          </ul>
         
          <p>
             I currently don't have any previous job experience related to my degree. I just got an internship with Aluma Form Inc.
             For my previous jobs, I worked at Marcos as a delivery driver, and I got a lot of experience with customer service.
             Before that, I worked at Newk's Eatery and did everything in the kitchen.
